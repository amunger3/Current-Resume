For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that

argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
